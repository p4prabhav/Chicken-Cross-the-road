Basic skeleton for a 'help the chicken cross the road' kind of game.

The goal of the game is to get to the other side of the screen and back as many
times as possible.

To run it, install python 2.x and pygame. Clone this repo, cd to cross-the-road,
 and run: `python game.py`.

This started life as a top-down RPG; I wanted to practice using classes and OOP
more generally. I got as far as putting two dots on the screen before I got
distracted thinking of how it could be an arcade game. So that might explain
some of the variable names; things called 'goblins' are now cars (not that you
can tell from the current graphics).

The difficulty needs fixing. It's too hard at the moment.

I'll hopefully clean up the code at some point.

If you have capslock, numlock or scroll-lock on, you will trigger on-ice mode,
where the player will not stop moving. It's not a bug; it's a feature...
